Tic Tac Total is a java program where you play Tic Tac Toe, but with numbers. The move options for player 1 are, [1, 3, 5]. The move options for player 2 are, [2, 4, 6]. To win against your AI opponent, you must place a number on the board in a diagonal, horizontal, or verticle line so the numbers add up to 13 on your turn.

Using the search algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning, the AI oppenent plays the most optimal move in order to win the game. The purpose of this program is to practice using alpha-beta purning, maps, tree maps, iterators, and a 2D int array.

To play this game, run the file, "T3Game", in an IDE. Both the column and row use the index 0 - 2.
